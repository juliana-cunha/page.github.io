I'm a PhD candidate in the Mathematics Department at the University of Aveiro supported by an FCT scholarship. I graduated in Mathematics from the University of Porto in 2020 and completed an MSc in Mathematics and Applications at the University of Aveiro in 2023, with a thesis titled "Towards a Specification Theory for Paraconsistent Transition Systems" [(available here)](https://ria.ua.pt/bitstream/10773/40670/1/Documento_Juliana_Cunha.pdf). My research interests include paraconsistent logics, automata theory, lattice theory, and formal specification. My work mainly focuses on building paraconsistent frameworks to reason about inconsistent information in a controlled and sound manner.
