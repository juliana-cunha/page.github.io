I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Aveiro in the Mathematics Department supported by a FCT scholarship. I graduated in Mathematics from the University of Porto in 2020 and finished a Msc in Mathematics and Applications at the University of Aveiro in 2023 with a tesis titled "Towards a Specification Theory for Paraconsistent Transition Systems"  [(available here)](https://ria.ua.pt/bitstream/10773/40670/1/Documento_Juliana_Cunha.pdf). My research interests are in paraconsistent logics, automata theory, lattice theory and formal specification. My research mainly focuses on using paraconsistent frameworks in order to reason with inconsistent information in a controlled and sound manner.
